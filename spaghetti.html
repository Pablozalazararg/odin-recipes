  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Twirl your fork into this vibrant Spaghetti with Fresh Tomato Sauce, a true Italian classic! Bursting with juicy tomatoes and aromatic basil, this dish will transport your taste buds straight to the heart of Italy.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 lb spaghetti(455 g)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 cups cherry tomato(400 g)
      salt, to taste
      pepper, to taste</li>
    <li>1 cup white wine(235 mL)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Preparation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook spaghetti in boiling salted water until it’s al dente. Reserve 1 cup (235 ml) of the pasta water before draining.</li>
    <li>While the spaghetti is cooking, heat olive oil in a large pan (it should be large enough to toss the pasta in). Add garlic and tomatoes, and stir until well-incorporated. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Cook tomatoes down for 5 minutes until they soften and release some of their juices.</li>
    <li>Then add the wine and allow that to reduce for 5-10 minutes until you’re left with a syrupy sauce.</li>
    <li>Add the pasta to your sauce, along with a splash of pasta water and toss to coat it for about 1-2 minutes so the pasta finishes cooking and absorbs the flavor of the sauce.</li>
    <li>Add the parmesan and basil. Add another small splash of pasta water, if needed. Toss until the cheese is melted down and you’re left with a smooth sauce.</li>
    <li>Gradually add small amounts of pasta water, as needed, until the sauce reaches your desired smoothness.</li>
    <li>Top off with extra parmesan and basil and serve immediately.</li>
  </ol>
